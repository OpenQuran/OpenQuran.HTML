# About the project #
The purpose of this project is to provide free quality tools for studying the central holy scripture of Islam - the Qur'an. Currently there exists a command-line tool which allows you to browse and search the Qur'an in the console. But don't shy away yet, because this tool also enables you to generate DHTML (HTML + JavaScript) files which will give you the same interactive GUI experience that you already know from full-blown applications. Everything happens in your browser and you don't have to use the dreaded black window with the odd, blinking cursor anymore (although people should really learn it as a different way to operate a computer.) Get started now:

  1. Download openquran for your operating system.
  1. Download the Qur'an files you are interested in and extract them into the openquran folder.
  1. If you're on Windows, start MakeHTML.bat and follow the instructions.

That's it! Open the generated DHTML file in a browser ([Firefox](http://www.firefox.com) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com) recommended) and enjoy a pretty and powerful Qur'an browser.
