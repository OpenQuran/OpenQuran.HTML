Description
-----------
openquran is a command-line utility, which enables you to list verses from
the Qur'an by specifying reference lists (e.g. 3:4-59; 33:12) and it allows you
to search various translations with normal, regular expression and fuzzy
queries.

Requirements
------------
Any hardware configuration should be able to run this program.
There are binaries for Windows and Linux systems.
Tested on Windows XP and (Ubuntu) Linux.

Installation
------------
There is no setup required. Open a console, change to the directory where you
extracted the program and enter "quran". You will see the main help message.

Translations
------------
The program comes without any Qur'an files. You can download the ones you're
interested in from this page:

Extract the archive(s) to the same folder where the executable resides.

Bugs
----
Every software has bugs. If you encountered issues with the program, or if you
have found an error in a Qur'an file (not in the style or semantics but in
terms of punctuation, spelling etc.), then please drop me an e-Mail
